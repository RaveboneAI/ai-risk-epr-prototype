# 🎊 Comprehensive EPR Update Complete!

## Summary

I've transformed your prototype into a **comprehensive, realistic EPR-style system** with clinical documentation, imaging results, varied alerts/allergies, and proper section organization.

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. **Comprehensive Patient Data**

Each of the 10 patients now has:

#### **Imaging & Investigations**
- Chest X-rays with detailed findings
- CT scans (Head, CTPA)
- ECGs with interpretation
- Echocardiograms
- Doppler ultrasounds
- ABG results
- Each with date, findings, and reporter name

#### **Clinical Assessments & Documentation**
- **MUST Score** - Malnutrition screening (documented by dietitians)
- **Waterlow Score** - Pressure ulcer risk (by tissue viability nurses)
- **STRATIFY/Falls Assessment** - Falls risk (by physiotherapists)
- **4AT Score** - Delirium screening (by nursing staff)
- **HAS-BLED Score** - Bleeding risk (by pharmacists)
- **CURB-65** - Pneumonia severity (by doctors)
- **Wells Score** - PE/DVT probability (by doctors)
- **NIHSS** - Stroke severity (by stroke physicians)
- **Sepsis 6 Bundle** - Sepsis protocol compliance

- **Each includes**: Date/time, assessor name, score, clinical notes

#### **Varied Allergies** (realistic examples)
- Penicillin - anaphylaxis

#### **Clinical Alerts** (context-specific)
- Falls Risk - 1:1 supervision
- VTE prophylaxis required
- Sepsis 6 pathway initiated
- Anticoagulated - bleeding risk
- Diabetic
- Heart failure - fluid balance
- Acute MI - CCU care
- DKA - ICU care
- Post-op monitoring
- PE suspected
- DNACPR in place
- Safeguarding alert
- Pressure ulcer present
- Polypharmacy review urgent
- Frailty score 8/9
- NIV candidate
- Steroid cover

### 2. **New UI Sections** (All Expandable/Collapsible)

The interface now has **6 distinct expandable sections**:

1. **Condition-specific risk** (12 assessments)
2. **NICE/NHSE Diagnosis Scoring** (when present)
3. **Imaging & Investigations** 🆕
4. **Clinical Assessments & Documentation** 🆕
5. **Laboratory Results** (separated)
6. **Vitals & Early Warning Score (NEWS2)** (separated)

### 3. **Documentation References**

Risk factors now reference actual clinical documentation:

**Example - Elizabeth Brown (p007):**
- Delirium Risk shows: "Based on 4AT score of 6 (Staff Nurse J. Smith, 15 Nov 2024)"
- Falls Risk shows: "STRATIFY score 4 - Physiotherapist M. Roberts"
- Malnutrition Risk shows: "MUST score 3 - Dietitian L. Green"
- Pressure Ulcer Risk shows: "Waterlow score 18 - Tissue Viability Nurse"

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Imaging Section
- Professional card layout

- Reporter attribution
- Color-coded headers
- Detailed findings display

### Assessments Section
- Grid layout for multiple assessments
- Score badges with color coding

### Separated Sections
- Labs and Vitals are now **completely separate** sections
- Each can be collapsed independently

- Better information organization

## 🔍 Documentation Sources Visible

Throughout the interface, you'll see references like:

- "MUST score of 5 in nursing MUST assessment (Dietitian L. Green)"
- "4AT score 6 from delirium screening (Staff Nurse K. Wilson)"
- "CURB-65 score 4 documented by Dr. H. Thompson"
- "Waterlow score 26 by Tissue Viability Nurse"
- "Wells Score 6.5 calculated by Dr. H. Thompson"

This shows which **actual clinical documentation** informed each risk assessment!

## 🚀 How to See It

1. **REFRESH YOUR BROWSER** (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R)

2. **Select any patient** - You'll immediately see:
   - Dynamic alerts in the patient banner
   - New "Imaging & Investigations" section (expanded by default)
   - New "Clinical Assessments & Documentation" section (expanded)
   - Separate "Laboratory Results" section (collapsed)
   - Separate "Vitals & Early Warning Score" section (collapsed)

3. **Expand each section** to see:
   - Detailed imaging reports with reporters
   - Formal assessment scores with assessors
   - Labs with abnormal indicators
   - NEWS2 table with risk stratification

4. **Try Patricia Martinez (p010)** for the most comprehensive example:
   - 2 imaging studies
   - 6 clinical assessments documented
   - 6 alerts showing
   - Multiple HIGH risks across 7 different categories

## 📊 Section Organization

The new flow is:

```
1. Patient Banner
   └─ Demographics, Allergies, Alerts, Overall Risk

2. Condition-specific risk (12 assessments) ▼
   └─ AKI, Sepsis, VTE, Delirium, Falls, etc.

3. NICE/NHSE Diagnosis Scoring ▼
   └─ PE, Heart Failure, Pneumonia, etc.

4. Imaging & Investigations (2-4 per patient) ▼
   └─ CXR, CT, ECG, Echo, etc. with findings

5. Clinical Assessments & Documentation (2-6 per patient) ▼
   └─ MUST, Waterlow, STRATIFY, 4AT, HAS-BLED, etc.

6. Laboratory Results ▶
   └─ Bloods with reference ranges

7. Vitals & Early Warning Score (NEWS2) ▶
   └─ Vital signs table with NEWS2 scores
```

## 🎯 Clinical Realism

- ✅ Multi-disciplinary documentation
- ✅ Formal assessment tools with scores
- ✅ Attribution to specific staff members
- ✅ Date/time stamps on all entries
- ✅ Varied alert types
- ✅ Comprehensive imaging reports

   - Tissue Viability Nurses, Stroke Physicians, Radiologists
   - Each documenting within their scope of practice

2. **Formal Assessment Tools**
   - MUST, Waterlow, STRATIFY (national standards)
   - NIHSS, CURB-65, Wells, HAS-BLED, 4AT
   - Clinical Frailty Scale, GRACE Score
   - All with proper scoring

3. **Temporal Information**
   - Assessments have specific dates/times
   - Imaging reports show when performed
   - Can see progression of care

4. **Clinical Context**
   - Alerts are patient-specific
   - Assessments match presenting complaints
   - Imaging supports diagnoses
   - Everything connects logically
